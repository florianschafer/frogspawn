 - Provide some good working examples
 - Explore generally only storing half the matrix!
 - Parallel connected components!
 - Equip affilitation metric with a "passed" function and remove minAffiliation to allow for arbitrary scores
 - Split up graph test base
 - Simplify API
 - Top-level pruning
 - Change traverseParallel signature: traverse(..., boolean parallel,...)
 - Revisit affiliation scoring from a more (solid) statistical pov
 - Provide (idempotent?) postprocessors with a list of clusters that need to be revisited instead of traversing the full tree.
 - Add possibility to let graph builders know the size in advance
 - Think about the parallel active self-correcting tree model with in-band "postprocessing"
 - Better serialization
 - Extend parent similarity test to hops > 1
 - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
 - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
 - Add some more tests to changes around parent processing
